# UFO Analysis

## Analysis Purpose

The purpose of this was to organize and analyze UFO sighting data.
We are given an array of Javascript objects to use to create a website where users can search by city, state, country, shape, and date.

## The website was created with the search criteria required. In the below images you can see examples of searches based on date and another based on the city.

Date search:

## Summary

A drawback found in this webpage is that it's case sensitive. A search for "CA" for California UFO sightings will give zero results, but "ca" will show all of the related results. Additionally, it's hard to tell what the date range for this data is without scrolling through to see what the options are. In the future, we can work on a way to make the information available more clear.
